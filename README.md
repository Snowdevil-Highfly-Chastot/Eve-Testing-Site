# Eve-Testing_Site
 A testing site which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and SCSS usage. This is a place to build and test prototype applications for Eve Online.

Currently, the Price Pull application uses the game's item_ids entered in the text area to compare to an API and returns the sell price for that item. It works with any amount of items, from 5 or 10 to thousands.
